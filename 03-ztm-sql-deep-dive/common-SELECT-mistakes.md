# Mistakes happen

Mostly because SQL developers are rarely just working with SQL.

- Spelling Mistakes
- Using ; instead of , 
  - *or vice-versa*
- Using " instead of ' 
  - *this is a big one*
  - use the single quote!! 
  - we use " for the table names, usually when we don't use noraml naming conventions
